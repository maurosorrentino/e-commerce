SEE IT ONLINE: (coming soon!)


This is a project made with React.js Next.js Node.js Express and MondoDB.

Header is the only component that has the style inside the same file. All the others components have the file into the "style" folder.

In order to run the project you need to go in both frontend and backend folders and run "npm install". 

Once you installed all the dependecies you need to run "npm run dev" into the frontend folder and "npm run" into the backend folder.

I have created an account "try@try.com" password: 12345 that you can use in order to navigate as an user.

The process of signing an user up does not check if the user has access to the email by sending a token for marketing choices (anyway is more or less the same code
as "reset password" process that I implemented and if they want they are able to change the email into the settings).

I wanted to make the life of the user as easy as possible when wanted to buy an item (best choice would be let them buy the item without signing up but this is a 
project for learning purposes so I wanted to implement this).

Have fun!
