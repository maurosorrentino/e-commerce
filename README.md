header component is the only one with the style into the same file, all the others components have the style into the style folder.

The only thing about the website is that sometimes Google blocks email sending for security reasons making some features not working (like signup, reset password and email me when available again) and I need to manually allow over and over these requests. As soon as I find a free service provider that sends email I will make the changes. You can use try@try.com with password 12345 for logging in.
